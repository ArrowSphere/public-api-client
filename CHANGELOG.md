## [0.3.0] - 2021-05-11
### Changed
- Adapted the code to handle the new /licenses/find v2 endpoint, which implicate several breaking changes (see below)
- The ```License``` entity has been moved to a sub namespace ```License``` of the ```Entities``` namespace to better sort the entities that have dependencies between them
- The ```License``` entity has been changed to reflect the arborescence of objects returned by the API, so 2 new classes have been created to handle this: ```ActiveSeats``` and ```Price```. See [Upgrade guide](UPGRADING.md#Changes to the license entity)
- The fields that need to be used with the licenses find endpoint must be prefixed. To handle this, use the ```LicenseFindFieldEnum``` consts. See [Upgrade guide](UPGRADING.md#Changes due to the integration of the v2 license endpoint)

### Fixed
- Added indices to the offers and licenses yields because the way they were built generated index reutilization with the default behavior of ```iterator_to_array```

## [0.2.5] - 2021-03-29
### Added
- Added "build lowest version" to the CI workflow, so now the tests are run against both the lowest and the highest dependencies of composer packages
- Added a new "static" workflow to add phpstan and psalm to perform some static-analysis on the codebase
- Added a "checks" workflow to perform some additional checks on the codebase

### Fixed
- The ```LicensesClient``` had a bug: if there were exactly 2 pages of results, the second page was not loaded
- The ```OfferClient``` had the same bug

### Changed
- Changed the Makefile so Psalm runs with the dev dependencies (so it doesn't uninstall them each time we run it)

## [0.2.4] - 2021-02-11
### Added
- The ```FamilyClient``` now has an optional argument named ```$parameters```, in all its methods, to allow adding optional parameters to the URL
- The ```CustomersClient``` has the same optional argument
- The ```CheckDomainClient``` has the same optional argument

### Fixed
- The ```License``` entity now allows ```null``` for the fields ```price.currency```, ```friendlyName```, and ```vendorSubscriptionId```

## [0.2.3] - 2021-02-10
### Added
- Customers client (list and create)

### Fixed
- The ```PublicApiClient::getFamilyClient()``` method has been fixed
- Removed old import in ```CatalogClientTest```, and added phpdoc at class-level for the client used in this test class

## [0.2.2] - 2021-02-01
### Added
- Added support for fields ```add_ons``` and ```prerequisites``` in the ```OfferClient::find``` method

## [0.2.1] - 2021-01-29

## [0.2.0] - 2021-01-28
### Added
- Family client

### Changed
- The ```curl/curl``` dependency has been dropped and replaced by ```guzzlehttp/guzzle``` which is vastly more popular and has more features

### Fixed
- The ```OfferClient::find()``` method now reworks the "filters" field to make sure that when the values are arrays, they are list-arrays and not associative arrays
- The ```LicensesClient::find()``` method now reworks the "filters" and the "values" field of the "keywords" field to make sure that when the values are arrays, they are list-arrays and not associative arrays
- Fixed incorrect payload in the ```LicensesClientTest```
