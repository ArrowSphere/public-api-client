## [Unreleased]
### Added
- General clients (Whoami, Check domain)
- Catalog clients (Classification, Program, Service, Offer, Addon)
- Consumption client (Health Check, Monthly Analytics)
- Licenses Client (Licenses, to perform the "find" operation like the Offer client)

### Deprecated
- CatalogClient: this is an old client that contained way too many endpoints
- AddonClient: the addons should not be differencied with the offers
- Entity Price: use PriceBand now, which is in the Catalog namespace where it belongs
- Entity Service: the root entity is deprecated, and the one in the Catalog namespace should be used
