### PriceBand
A price band is a price available for an offer under certain conditions:
- quantity (how many licenses the customer wants to purchase)
- term (for how long the customer commits himself)
- periodicity (how frequently the customer needs to pay)
- currency (in what currency the customer needs to pay)

The prices can change depending on these parameters, hence the concept of price bands.

A price band is managed by the ```PriceBand``` entity.

## Usage
The offer client is simply called ```OfferClient```.
You can get it through the main entry point ```PublicApiClient``` and its method ```getOfferClient()```, or instanciate it directly.

ArrowSphere has designed a new way to search through offers and access their details, 
to make it easier to perform searchs and display an offer's details.
This is the encouraged way to access offers in ArrowSphere. See paragraph [Find and Details endpoints](#Find and Details endpoints) 
below for the documentation.

The old way to access offers is still available, though, but the methods are marked as deprecated and are unlikely to be updated.
The documentation for the old endpoints is below, see paragraph [Legacy endpoints](#Legacy endpoints).

### Find and Details endpoints

#### Find endpoint

The "Find" endpoint has been designed specifically to perform quick and easy search through the offers of the catalog.
This is the endpoint called by xSP on its search bar and on the listing pages.

For perfomance reasons, this endpoint doesn't provide all the fields of the offers. It only returns a subset of these fields.

The postData is supposed to contain the following keys:
- ```OfferClient::DATA_KEYWORDS```: a string to be searched in all the fields. Supports inexact matches (i.e. Ofice for Office)
- ```OfferClient::DATA_FILTERS```: an array of strings containing exact matches for individual fields (field name as key and field value as value)
- ```OfferClient::DATA_SORT```: an array of strings containing the order in which sort the data (field name as key and a ```OfferClient::SORT_*``` const for the sort direction)
- ```OfferClient::DATA_HIGHLIGHT```: a boolean value, search results will contain a field giving highlights if set to ```true``` (defaults to ```false```)
- ```OfferClient::DATA_TOP_OFFERS```: search results will provide top offers if set to ```true``` (defaults to ```false```)

Please note that the field names must be used with the ```Offer::COLUMN_*``` consts from the ```Offer``` entity class.

```php
<?php

use ArrowSphere\PublicApiClient\Catalog\OfferClient;
use ArrowSphere\PublicApiClient\Catalog\Entities\Offer;

const URL = 'https://your-url-to-arrowsphere.example.com';
const API_KEY = 'your API key in ArrowSphere';

$client = (new OfferClient())
    ->setUrl(URL)
    ->setApiKey(API_KEY);

$searchResult = $client->find([
    OfferClient::DATA_KEYWORDS   => 'microsoft 365',
    OfferClient::DATA_FILTERS    => [
        Offer::COLUMN_VENDOR => 'Microsoft',
    ],
    OfferClient::DATA_SORT       => [
        Offer::COLUMN_NAME => OfferClient::SORT_DESCENDING,
    ],
    OfferClient::DATA_HIGHLIGHT  => true,
    OfferClient::DATA_TOP_OFFERS => true,
]);

echo $searchResult->getNbResults() . ' results were found' . PHP_EOL;
echo $searchResult->getTotalPages() . ' pages' . PHP_EOL;

$topOffers = $searchResult->getTopOffers();
echo count($topOffers) . ' top offers found' . PHP_EOL;
foreach ($topOffers as $offer) {
    echo "Top offer: " . $offer->getName() . PHP_EOL;
}

$filters = $searchResult->getFilters();
foreach ($filters as $filter) {
    echo $filter->getName() . ': ' . print_r($filter->getValues(), true) . PHP_EOL;
}

// You can get the current page's results
$offers = $searchResult->getOffersForCurrentPage();
foreach ($offers as $offer) {
    echo $offer->getName() . PHP_EOL;
}

// You can also browse directly through all the results
// this will make the API call as many times as needed and traverse all the pages
$offers = $searchResult->getOffers();
foreach ($offers as $offer) {
    echo $offer->getName() . PHP_EOL;
}
```

The ```OfferClient::find()``` method returns a ```FindResult``` object that allows these methods:
- ```getNbResults()```: returns the total number of results for this search
- ```getTotalPages()```: returns the total number of pages for this search
- ```getFilters()```: returns an array of ```FilterFindResult``` entities (see [FilterFindResult entity](#FilterFindResult))
- ```getOffersForCurrentPage()```: returns a ```Generator``` and yields instances of the ```OfferFindResult``` entity (see [OfferFindResult entity](#OfferFindResult))
- ```getOffers()```: returns a ```Generator``` and yields instances of the ```OfferFindResult``` entity

The difference between ```getOffersForCurrentPage()``` and ```getOffers()``` is that ```getOffersForCurrentPage()``` only shows the results for the current page, you have to perform a new ```find()``` passing another ```$page``` to get more offers. ```getOffers()``` automatically calls the API as many times as needed and yields all the offers for the search results.

#### Details endpoint

The "Details" endpoint allows seeing detailed information about a particular offer.

```php
<?php

use ArrowSphere\PublicApiClient\Catalog\OfferClient;

const URL = 'https://your-url-to-arrowsphere.example.com';
const API_KEY = 'your API key in ArrowSphere';

$client = (new OfferClient())
    ->setUrl(URL)
    ->setApiKey(API_KEY);

$offer = $client->getOfferDetails('SAAS', 'microsoft', '031C9E47-4802-4248-838E-778FB1D2CC05');
echo $offer->getName() . PHP_EOL;
```

The ```OfferClient::getOfferDetails()``` method returns an ```Offer``` entity (see [Offer entity](#Offer)).

### Legacy endpoints

```php
<?php

use ArrowSphere\PublicApiClient\Catalog\OfferClient;

const URL = 'https://your-url-to-arrowsphere.example.com';
const API_KEY = 'your API key in ArrowSphere';

$client = (new OfferClient())
    ->setUrl(URL)
    ->setApiKey(API_KEY);

$offers = $client->getOffers('SAAS', 'microsoft', 'MS-0A-O365-BUSINESS');
foreach ($offers as $offer) {
    echo $offer->getName() . PHP_EOL;
}

$offer = $client->getOffer('SAAS', 'microsoft', 'MS-0A-O365-BUSINESS', '031C9E47-4802-4248-838E-778FB1D2CC05');
echo $offer->getName() . PHP_EOL;
```

You can list all the offers of a [service](catalog-service.md) by calling the ```getOffers()``` method with the following parameters:
- ```string $classification```: the [classification](catalog-classification.md) (ex. ```'SAAS'```)
- ```string $program```: the [program](catalog-program.md) (ex. ```'microsoft'```)
- ```string $serviceRef```: the [service](catalog-service.md) (ex. ```'MS-0A-O365-BUSINESS'```)

Please note that the ```$serviceRef``` parameter is case-sensitive. The other parameters are case-insensitive.

This method returns a ```Generator``` and yields instances of the ```Offer``` entity.

You can also get a particular offer by calling the ```getOffer()``` method with the following parameters:
- ```string $classification```: the [classification](catalog-classification.md) (ex. ```'SAAS'```)
- ```string $program```: the [program](catalog-program.md) (ex. ```'microsoft'```)
- ```string $serviceRef```: the [service](catalog-service.md) (ex. ```'MS-0A-O365-BUSINESS'```)
- ```string $sku```: the sku (ex. ```'031C9E47-4802-4248-838E-778FB1D2CC05'```)

Please note that the ```$serviceRef``` and ```$sku``` parameters are case-sensitive. The other parameters are case-insensitive.
