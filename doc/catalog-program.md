# Catalog Program Client

## General information

A program is a specific set of offers of a vendor.

Please note that it's technically possible for a vendor to provide multiple programs.

## Entity

A program is managed by the `Program` entity.

## Usage

The program client is simply called `ProgramClient`.
You can get it through the main entry point `PublicApiClient` and its method `getProgramClient()`, or instanciate it directly:

```php
<?php

use ArrowSphere\PublicApiClient\Catalog\ProgramClient;

const URL = 'https://your-url-to-arrowsphere.example.com';
const API_KEY = 'your API key in ArrowSphere';

$client = (new ProgramClient())
    ->setUrl(URL)
    ->setApiKey(API_KEY);

$programs = $client->getPrograms('SAAS');
foreach ($programs as $program) {
    echo $program->getName() . PHP_EOL;
}

$program = $client->getProgram('SAAS', 'microsoft');
echo $program->getName() . PHP_EOL;
```

You can list all the programs of a [classification](catalog-classification.md) by calling the `getPrograms()` method with the following parameters:

- `string $classification`: the [classification](catalog-classification.md) (ex. `'SAAS'`)

This parameter is case-insensitive.

This method returns a `Generator` and yields instances of the `Program` entity.

You can also get a particular program by calling the `getProgram()` method with the following parameters:

- `string $classification`: the [classification](catalog-classification.md) (ex. `'SAAS'`)
- `string $program`: the program (ex. `'microsoft'`)

These parameters are case-insensitive.
