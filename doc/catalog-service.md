# Catalog Service Client

## Deprecated

This client is deprecated, and the associated endpoints are deprecated. You should use the [families](catalog-family.md) instead.

## General information

A service is group of offers, used by ArrowSphere to avoid having too many
offers all at once if a vendor has too many of them.

## Entity

A service is managed by the `Service` entity.

## Usage

The service client is simply called `ServiceClient`.
You can get it through the main entry point `PublicApiClient` and its method `getServiceClient()`, or instanciate it directly:

```php
<?php

use ArrowSphere\PublicApiClient\Catalog\ServiceClient;

const URL = 'https://your-url-to-arrowsphere.example.com';
const API_KEY = 'your API key in ArrowSphere';

$client = (new ServiceClient())
    ->setUrl(URL)
    ->setApiKey(API_KEY);

$services = $client->getServices('SAAS', 'microsoft');
foreach ($services as $service) {
    echo $service->getName() . PHP_EOL;
}

$service = $client->getService('SAAS', 'microsoft', 'MS-0A-O365-BUSINESS');
echo $service->getName() . PHP_EOL;
```

You can list all the services of a [program](catalog-program.md) by calling the `getServices()` method with the following parameters:

- `string $classification`: the [classification](catalog-classification.md) (ex. `'SAAS'`)
- `string $program`: the [program](catalog-program.md) (ex. `'microsoft'`)

These parameters are case-insensitive.

This method returns a `Generator` and yields instances of the `Service` entity.

You can also get a particular service by calling the `getService()` method with the following parameters:

- `string $classification`: the [classification](catalog-classification.md) (ex. `'SAAS'`)
- `string $program`: the [program](catalog-program.md) (ex. `'microsoft'`)
- `string $serviceRef`: the service (ex. `'MS-0A-O365-BUSINESS'`)

Please note that the `$serviceRef` parameter is case-sensitive.
