## Usage
The campaigns client is simply called ```CampaignsClient```.
You can get it through the main entry point ```PublicApiClient``` and its method ```getCampaignsClient()```, or instanciate it directly.

### GetCampaigns

The "GetCampaigns" endpoint has been designed specifically to retrieve quickly all the campaigns.
This is the endpoint called by xSP on the Cloud Portal Campaigns page.

The ```CampaignsClient::getCampaigns()``` method returns a ```string``` that is the json containing the results.

### GetCampaign, GetCampaignAssets & GetCampaignAssetsUploadUrl

The "GetCampaign" endpoint is used to retrieve one specific campaign. "GetCampaignAssets" retrieves the assets of the campaigns, linked with the main object using UUID. The "GetCampaignAssetsUploadUrl" retrieves the url needed to upload any assets for the campaign. These too are linked with an UUID.
These endpoints are called by xSP on the Cloud Portal Campaign "View" or "Edit" pages.

This three endpoints are using the campaign's ```reference``` as parameters. The ```CampaignsClient::getCampaign()``` method returns a ```Campaign``` object, while ```CampaignsClient::getCampaignsAssets()``` and ```CampaignsClient::getCampaignAssetsUploadUrl()``` return a json ```string```.

### CreateCampaign

The "CreateCampaign" endpoint is used to create a campaign by using its ```name``` and ```category```. These are the only parameters requiered for the creation. 

The ```CampaignsClient::createCampaign()``` method returns a ```string``` that is the json defining the campaign.

### SaveCampaign

The "SaveCampaign" endpoint is used to save a campaign, using the json string of the campaign and its ```reference``` as parameters.

The ```CampaignsClient::saveCampaign()``` method returns a ```string``` that is the json defining the campaign.

### DuplicateCampaign

The "DuplicateCampaign" endpoint is used to duplicate a campaign, using the ```reference``` as parameters. It will create a new campaign with the same data (and assets), and name the new one by adding ```_COPY``` at the end of its name.

The ```CampaignsClient::duplicateCampaign()``` method returns a ```string``` that is the json defining the new campaign.

### DeleteCampaign & DeleteAssets

The "DeleteCampaign" endpoint is used to delete a campaign, using the ```reference``` as parameters. 
The "DeleteAsset" endpoint is used to delete a specific asset of a campaign, using the ```reference``` of the campaign and the ```uuid``` of the asset as parameters. 

The ```CampaignsClient::deleteCampaign()``` and ```CampaignsClient::deleteAsset()``` methods both return a string without content.
