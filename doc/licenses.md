### Other entities

#### FindResult

This entity is the main wrapper of the search result, returned by the [Find endpoint](#find-endpoint).
It contains the [filters](#FilterFindResult) and the [license/offers](#LicenseOfferFindResult) returned for the search.

#### FilterFindResult

This entity represents a filter returned by the [Find endpoint](#find-endpoint).
It shows a number of possible filters in the search results and the count for each of them.

| Field  | Type     | Example     | Description              |
| ------ | -------- | ----------- | ------------------------ |
| name   | `string` | vendor      | The name of the filter   |
| values | `array`  | (see below) | The values of the filter |

Each entry in the `values` array looks like this:

| Field | Type     | Example   | Description                                   |
| ----- | -------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| value | `string` | Microsoft | The value of the entry                        |
| count | `int`    | 3         | How many results are available for this entry |

The focus of these filters is to allow to display them to the user as a list of checkboxes
with how many results are available in each of them.

#### LicenseOfferFindResult

This entity represents a search result.
A search result is a combination of the [License](#License) entity and the [Offer](#Offer) entity.
All fields of both the [License](#License) entity and the [Offer](#Offer) entity are available.
This entity should be used to display search results or to make a listing of licenses.

| Field     | Type      | Example                           | Description                                                                                      |
| --------- | --------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| highlight | `array`   | ['sku' => '<strong>ABC</strong>'] | An associative array which shows which values are to be highlighted based on the search keywords |
| license   | `License` |                                   | All the fields contained in the [License](#License) entity                                       |
| offer     | `Offer`   |                                   | All the fields contained in the [Offer](#Offer) entity                                           |

Please note that the `highlight` field is only available if the `DATA_HIGHLIGHT` option is set to `true` while searching.

## Usage

The license client is simply called `LicensesClient`.
You can get it through the main entry point `PublicApiClient` and its method `getLicensesClient()`, or instanciate it directly.

## Term and periodicity

The term and periodicity are two key-concepts to understand in ArrowSphere.
These values represent time values, expressed as hours, using a basis of 24 hours a day, 30 days a month, 360 days a year.

The term is the customer's commitment. He has to pay as long as the term value.
The periodicity, also known as billing cycle, is the deadline at which the customer is billed.

For example, the typical license has a term of 8640 and a periodicity of 720, which means the customer is committed for 1 year, and he is billed every month.
Here are some possible values for these values:

| value | Term         | Periodicity                 |
| ----- | ------------ | --------------------------- |
| 0     | No term      | one time (no billing cycle) |
| 24    | One day      | Daily                       |
| 720   | One month    | Monthly                     |
| 2160  | Three months | Per quarter                 |
| 8640  | One year     | Yearly                      |

### Find endpoint

The "Find" endpoint has been designed specifically to perform quick and easy search through the licenses.
This is the endpoint called by xSP on its search bar and on the listing pages

The postData is supposed to contain the following keys:

- `LicensesClient::DATA_KEYWORD`: a string to be searched in all the fields. Supports inexact matches (i.e. Ofice for Office)
- `LicensesClient::DATA_KEYWORDS`: an array containing the fields to search on, and their possible values, as well as an operator to specify how to use them. This array is indexed by column name, then contains 2 keys with `LicensesClient::KEYWORDS_VALUES` containing the values and `LicensesClient::KEYWORDS_OPERATOR` containing an operator (use `LicensesClient::OPERATOR_AND`, `LicensesClient::OPERATOR_OR` or `LicensesClient::OPERATOR_BETWEEN` for the operator)
- `LicensesClient::DATA_COMPARE`: an array containing the fields to compare on, and their field to compare, as well as an operator to specify how to make compare. This array is indexed by column name, then contains 2 keys with `LicensesClient::COMPARE_FIELD` containing the column you want to compare with and `LicensesClient::COMPARE_OPERATOR` containing an operator (use `LicensesClient::OPERATOR_EQ`, `LicensesClient::OPERATOR_NEQ`, `LicensesClient::OPERATOR_GT`, `LicensesClient::OPERATOR_LT` or `LicensesClient::OPERATOR_LTE` for the operator)
- `LicensesClient::DATA_FILTERS`: an array of strings containing exact matches for individual fields (field name as key and field value as value)
- `LicensesClient::DATA_EXCLUSION_FILTERS`: an array of strings containing must not matches for individual fields (field name as key and field value as value)
- `LicensesClient::DATA_SORT`: an array of strings containing the order in which sort the data (field name as key and a `LicensesClient::SORT_*` const for the sort direction)
- `LicensesClient::DATA_HIGHLIGHT`: a boolean value, search results will contain a field giving highlights if set to `true` (defaults to `false`)

Please note that the field names must be used with the consts from the `LicenseFindFieldEnum` class.

```php
<?php

use ArrowSphere\PublicApiClient\Licenses\LicensesClient;
use ArrowSphere\PublicApiClient\Licenses\Enum\LicenseFindFieldEnum;

const URL = 'https://your-url-to-arrowsphere.example.com';
const API_KEY = 'your API key in ArrowSphere';

$client = (new LicensesClient())
    ->setUrl(URL)
    ->setApiKey(API_KEY);

$searchResult = $client->find([
    LicensesClient::DATA_KEYWORD   => 'microsoft 365',
    LicensesClient::DATA_KEYWORDS => [
        LicenseFindFieldEnum::LICENSE_END_DATE => [
            LicensesClient::KEYWORDS_VALUES => [
                '2021-03-01T00:00:00.000Z',
                '2021-03-31T23:59:59.000Z',
            ],
            LicensesClient::KEYWORDS_OPERATOR => LicensesClient::OPERATOR_BETWEEN,
        ]
    ],
    LicensesClient::DATA_COMPARE => [
        LicenseFindFieldEnum::LICENSE_PRICE_BUY_PRICE => [
            LicensesClient::COMPARE_FIELD => LicenseFindFieldEnum::OFFER_PRICE_BAND_PRICES_BUY,
            LicensesClient::COMPARE_OPERATOR => LicensesClient::OPERATOR_GT,  
        ]
    ],
    LicensesClient::DATA_FILTERS    => [
        LicenseFindFieldEnum::LICENSE_IS_ENABLED => true,
    ],
    LicensesClient::DATA_EXCLUSION_FILTERS    => [
        LicenseFindFieldEnum::LICENSE_WARNINGS => 'PEC ratio issue',
    ],
    LicensesClient::DATA_SORT       => [
        LicenseFindFieldEnum::LICENSE_CUSTOMER_NAME => LicensesClient::SORT_DESCENDING,
    ],
    LicensesClient::DATA_HIGHLIGHT  => true,
]);

echo $searchResult->getNbResults() . ' results were found' . PHP_EOL;
echo $searchResult->getTotalPages() . ' pages' . PHP_EOL;

$filters = $searchResult->getFilters();
foreach ($filters as $filter) {
    echo $filter->getName() . ': ' . print_r($filter->getValues(), true) . PHP_EOL;
}
    
// You can get the current page's results
$licenses = $searchResult->getLicensesForCurrentPage();
foreach ($licenses as $license) {
    echo $license->getPartnerRef() . PHP_EOL;
}

// You can also browse directly through all the results
// this will make the API call as many times as needed and traverse all the pages
$licenses = $searchResult->getLicenses();
foreach ($licenses as $license) {
    echo $license->getPartnerRef() . PHP_EOL;
}
```

The `LicensesClient::find()` method returns a `FindResult` object that allows these methods:

- `getNbResults()`: returns the total number of results for this search
- `getTotalPages()`: returns the total number of pages for this search
- `getFilters()`: returns an array of `FilterFindResult` entities (see [FilterFindResult entity](#FilterFindResult))
- `getLicensesForCurrentPage()`: returns a `Generator` and yields instances of the `LicenseOfferFindResult` entity (see [LicenseOfferFindResult entity](#LicenseOfferFindResult))
- `getLicenses()`: returns a `Generator` and yields instances of the `LicenseOfferFindResult` entity

The difference between `getLicensesForCurrentPage()` and `getLicenses()` is that `getLicensesForCurrentPage()` only shows the results for the current page, you have to perform a new `find()` passing another `$page` to get more licenses. `getLicenses()` automatically calls the API as many times as needed and yields all the licenses for the search results.

### GetConfigs endpoint

The "GetConfigs" endpoint retrieve every configurations for a specific customer's license.
This endpoint is used by xSP to get some up-to-date information pertaining to a customer's license configuration.

When calling it, it is necessary to specify desired license reference and partner reference (as previously described).

```php
<?php

use ArrowSphere\PublicApiClient\Licenses\LicensesClient;

const URL = 'https://your-url-to-arrowsphere.example.com';
const API_KEY = 'your API key in ArrowSphere';

$client = (new LicensesClient())
    ->setUrl(URL)
    ->setApiKey(API_KEY);

$configs = $client->getConfigs('XSP1234');
foreach ($configs as $config) {
    echo $config->getScope() . PHP_EOL
        . $config->getName() . PHP_EOL
        . $config->getState() . PHP_EOL . PHP_EOL;
}
```

The `LicensesClient::getConfigs()` method returns a `Generator` and yields instances of the `Config` entity.

- `getScope()`: returns the scope of this configuration
- `getName()`: returns the name of the configuration
- `getState()`: returns one of the 3 possible states which are `disabled`, `enabled` and `pending`

### UpdateConfig endpoint

The "UpdateConfig" endpoint allows creating or updating a license configuration.

It is necessary to specify desired license reference and desired configuration data.
It should be noted that endpoint will return an error (ie a not-200 result code) if it is called to update a configuration which state is 'pending'. The same will happen if an update is requested for a configuration which state is identical to the given one.

```php
<?php

use ArrowSphere\PublicApiClient\Licenses\LicensesClient;
use ArrowSphere\PublicApiClient\Licenses\Entities\License\Config;

const URL = 'https://your-url-to-arrowsphere.example.com';
const API_KEY = 'your API key in ArrowSphere';

$client = (new LicensesClient())
    ->setUrl(URL)
    ->setApiKey(API_KEY);

$configToUpdate = new Config([
    'name' => 'purchaseReservations',
    'scope' => 'role',
    'state' => 'enabled'
]);

$config = $client->updateConfig('XSP1234', $configToUpdate);

echo $config->getName() . ' is now ' . $config->getState() . PHP_EOL . PHP_EOL;
```

The `LicensesClient::updateConfig()` method returns a `Config` with actualized values.

- `getName()`: returns the name of the configuration
- `getState()`: returns one of the 3 possible states which are `disabled`, `enabled` and `pending`
