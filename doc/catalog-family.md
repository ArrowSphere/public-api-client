# Catalog Family Client

## General information

A family is group of offers, used by ArrowSphere to avoid having too many
offers all at once if a vendor has too many of them.

The term "family" replaces the legacy term "service".

## Entity

A family is managed by the `Family` entity.

## Usage

The family client is simply called `FamilyClient`.
You can get it through the main entry point `PublicApiClient` and its method `getFamilyClient()`, or instanciate it directly:

```php
<?php

use ArrowSphere\PublicApiClient\Catalog\FamilyClient;

const URL = 'https://your-url-to-arrowsphere.example.com';
const API_KEY = 'your API key in ArrowSphere';

$client = (new FamilyClient())
    ->setUrl(URL)
    ->setApiKey(API_KEY);

$families = $client->getFamilies('microsoft');
foreach ($families as $family) {
    echo $family->getName() . PHP_EOL;
}

$family = $client->getFamily('microsoft', 'MS-0A-O365-BUSINESS');
echo $family->getName() . PHP_EOL;
```

You can list all the families of a [program](catalog-program.md) by calling the `getFamilies()` method with the following parameters:

- `string $vendorCode`: the [program](catalog-program.md) (ex. `'microsoft'`)

This parameter is case-insensitive.

This method returns a `Generator` and yields instances of the `Family` entity.

You can also get a particular family by calling the `getFamily()` method with the following parameters:

- `string $vendorCode`: the [program](catalog-program.md) (ex. `'microsoft'`)
- `string $reference`: the reference of the family (ex. `'MS-0A-O365-BUSINESS'`)

Please note that the `$reference` parameter is case-sensitive. The other parameters are case-insensitive.
